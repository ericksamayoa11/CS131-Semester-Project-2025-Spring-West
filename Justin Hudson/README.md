# CS131 Spring 2025 Semester Project - Justin Hudson
## Discrete Structures in Natural Language Processing (NLP)
### Project Description
My presentation is on the subject of Natural Language Processing (NLP), the use of computer technology to assist in the processing, categorizing, analyzing, or interpreting of human language. Specifically, my focus is on how Natural Language Processing uses several of the discrete structures we have studied this semester. Matrices, algorithms, discrete probability, and graphs all play a very important role in converting the complexities of human language into structures computers can comprehend.
