Project Description:
This project explores Brain-Computer Interfaces (BCIs)â€”systems that enable direct communication between the human brain and external devices.
It covers how BCIs work,
current real-world applications, and their integration with AI to create intelligent neuro-adaptive systems.
The presentation also highlights ethical and privacy concerns, including data ownership and the risks of mental surveillance,
as well as the exciting future possibilities such as telepathic communication and memory enhancement. 
The goal is to inform and spark discussion about the powerful potential and responsibilities that come with BCI technology.
