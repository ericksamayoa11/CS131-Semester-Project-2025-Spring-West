## 📝 Summary
This presentation examines the 
principles and applications of Quantum Cryptography, 
focusing on Quantum Key Distribution (QKD) via the BB84 protocol. 
It highlights how quantum mechanics enables secure key exchange by 
detecting eavesdropping through measurement disturbance. 
Real-world implementations, such as China’s Micius satellite. 
The presentation also addresses current limitations—such as cost, distance, and hardware 
sensitivity—and concludes by exploring QKD’s emerging role in building quantum-resilient 
communication systems for the post-quantum era.
