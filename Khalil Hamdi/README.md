Project description:
This project explores how artificial intelligence is transforming robotics in 2025, from factory floors to humanoid helpers. I cover the evolution of AI in robotics, key technical breakthroughs like reinforcement learning and multimodal models, and real-world deployments by companies like NVIDIA and Tesla. You'll also hear about the major challenges—like energy use and safety—and the ethical questions shaping the future.

I created a 6-minute recorded presentation that’s fast-paced, informative, and (hopefully) fun to watch. Whether you're into machine learning, hardware, or just curious about where robots are headed, this overview should give you a clear picture of what’s next in this field.

Topics Include:

    The rise of generalist AI models (like NVIDIA’s GROOT N1)

    Tesla’s humanoid robot Optimus and Dojo supercomputer

    Key AI techniques in robotics (RL, vision, NLP, imitation)

    Challenges: safety, energy, generalization

    Career trends and global investments in AI & robotics

Feedback or questions welcome!
