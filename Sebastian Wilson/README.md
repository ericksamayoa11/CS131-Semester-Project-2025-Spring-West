## üìù Summary

In my video/presentation about Artificial Intelligence, I explore the evolution, core 
technologies, and real-world impact of AI. I explain how machine learning and neural networks 
allow computers to learn from data and perform tasks like language processing and image recognition. 
The video highlights how AI is used across industries such as healthcare, finance, transportation, and education, while 
also addressing ethical concerns like algorithmic bias, privacy, and job automation. Finally, I look ahead to the 
future of AI and the importance of developing these technologies responsibly.
