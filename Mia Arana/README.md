üìù Summary

This is my presentation for CS 131 Spring 2025. It's based on LLM Comparisons. I talked about what LLM is, its purpose, and its evolution. I also discussed the dependence of these AI systems. I showed graphs and tables to further show everyone statistically by country, age groups, and usage daily, weekly, and monthly. 
I showed an example of using ChatGPT for writing code in C++ about writing a game of rock, paper, scissors. I hope this presentation was well-informed.
